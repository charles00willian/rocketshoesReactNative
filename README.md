# rocketshoesReactNative
This is the <a href="https://github.com/charles00willian/rocketshoes">RocketShoes Store's</a> mobile version.

This app was created using the following:
<li>React Native </li>
<li>Redux </li>
<li>Reactotron for debugging </li>

Note: the IOS version hasn't been tested, since I don't have a device, nor the tools to do so.
